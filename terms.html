      <h1 id="terms-of-use">Terms of Use</h1>

      <h2 id="1-general-information">1. General Information</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of the Aqualoop mobile application (“the App”),
        developed and provided by Vendavis Solutions. By installing or using the App, you agree to
        these Terms; if you do not agree, please do not use the App. Aqualoop is a simple daily water
        tracking application that operates fully offline and stores all hydration data exclusively on your device.
      </p>

      <h2 id="2-license-and-usage-rights">2. License and Usage Rights</h2>
      <p>
        You are granted a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to use Aqualoop on your own
        devices for personal, non-commercial purposes. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or modify
        the App’s source code, distribute, resell, or sublicense the App, or use the App in any unlawful
        or misleading way. All rights, titles, and interests in and to Aqualoop, including its code,
        design, and branding, remain the property of Vendavis Solutions.
      </p>

      <h2 id="3-in-app-purchases">3. In-App Purchases</h2>
      <p>
        Aqualoop may offer optional one-time purchases or upgrades (for example, to unlock additional
        features). Any purchases are processed through the official App Store platforms (such as Apple’s
        App Store) and are subject to their respective terms and refund policies. Aqualoop does not handle
        or store any payment data; all transactions are managed by the store provider. Once purchased, the
        license is linked to your App Store account and can typically be restored after reinstallation via
        the store’s restore mechanisms.
      </p>

      <h2 id="4-data-privacy">4. Data Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Aqualoop does not collect, store, or transmit your hydration data to external servers. All
        information you enter remains on your device and under your full control. For more details on data
        handling and privacy, please refer to our
        <a href="https://vendavis-solutions.github.io/aqualoop/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="5-liability-disclaimer">5. Liability Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        The App is provided “as is” without any warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but
        not limited to fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement. While care is taken to make
        the App reliable, Vendavis Solutions does not guarantee that Aqualoop will be error-free,
        uninterrupted, or that it will meet all your expectations. You are solely responsible for how you
        interpret and use the hydration information shown in the App and for maintaining any backups of
        your data.
      </p>

      <h2 id="6-backups-and-data-responsibility">6. Backups and Data Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        All data management and backups are your responsibility as the user. Aqualoop may provide local
        reset or export options, but it does not automatically sync or back up your data to the cloud.
        If you delete the App or lose access to your device, any locally stored data may be permanently
        lost, and Vendavis Solutions cannot restore it.
      </p>

      <h2 id="7-updates-and-modifications">7. Updates and Modifications</h2>
      <p>
        Vendavis Solutions may update Aqualoop from time to time to improve performance, fix bugs, add or
        change features, or comply with legal and platform requirements. These updates may modify or
        remove certain functions. The Terms may also be updated; the latest version will be made
        available via our official website or repository page for Aqualoop.
      </p>

      <h2 id="8-termination-of-use">8. Termination of Use</h2>
      <p>
        You may stop using Aqualoop at any time by uninstalling it from your device. Vendavis Solutions
        reserves the right to revoke access or restrict functionality if the App is misused, modified,
        or used in violation of these Terms or applicable law.
      </p>
